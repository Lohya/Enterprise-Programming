                                            PERMISSION APPROVAL SYSTEM


The fundamental goal of this project is to get any sort of permission online by simply sending a message to the concerned authority like leader or manager.
Generally getting permission follows the hierarchy of leader and manager in corporate companies. So, when an employee wants to get approval to his leave, he sends a request message to the leader.
The leader approves if he finds it sensible and sends for the approval of manager. He does the same. If he affirms leave, a letter will be generated with a unique id where employee can use it for other purposes.
In this project we have 3 modules:

 • Employee Module 
 
• Leader Module 

• Manager Module 

Employee Module: In this employee module, he/she logins with his/her credentials such as their id, password and has a dashboard with different options like apply for permissions where they can apply to any permissions like leaves etc so to get the approval from the higher authorities, view permissions where they can see all their past permissions (if they ever applied) etc.

Leader Module: In this leader module, he/she must approve the request sent by the employee and pass it to the manager. Otherwise, if the manager denied the permission, then they need to send a message as “request for permission denied”. 

Manager Module: In this manger module, if the permission is approved a bill will be generated otherwise a message will be displayed as in denying the permission that is requested from them.

In this project we tried to get any sort of permission online for employee by just sending a message to the leader and then it going to the manager to grant the permission 
if they see fit by using the front ends (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), middleware (JSP), backend (MySQL).
And we also used IDE-Eclipse with software like Apache tomcat and JDK. If we do extend this project and develop it further,
we can easily get the answers to the requests for the permissions without doing it all manually.
